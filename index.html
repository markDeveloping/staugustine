			<h2>Parental involvement</h2>
			<p>Parental involvement is encouraged, as you are as much a part of the Pre-school as your children are.  It is beneficial to you and your child/children to share their Pre-school experience.  With this in mind a parent duty rota is available to which you may sign up to.</p>
			<p>If you have any special talents; for example playing an instrument, an interesting job or would like to share your cultural background with us, please let us know. The children would enjoy hearing from you.</p>
			<p>A weekly email is sent to parents informing them of what the children will be doing in Pre-school the following week and any other information.</p>
			<h2>School Dress and Toilet Guidelines</h2>
			<p>Please dress your children in practical clothing that you feel will not be spoilt if paint, glue and grass stains etc get on them. Aprons are provided for messy play but do not cover the whole of your child’s clothing. Pre-school t-shirts and sweatshirts are available for purchase. These are not compulsory but give a sense of belonging – please see link on our home page if you wish to print an order form.</p>
			<p>Please bring your child to pre-school with a spare pair of trousers/skirt and pants as even when toilet trained accidents do happen.If your child is in nappies we ask that you provide a clearly labelled bag with spare nappies, wipes and nappy sacks.</p>
			<p>We encourage children to be independent when going to the toilet and handle their own clothing.  Please help us by ensuring clothes are suitable, for example dungarees are not advisable and all clothing and bags are named.</p>
			<h2>Special educational needs</h2>
			<p>St. Augustine’s Pre-school follows the statutory requirements for children with additional needs.  We aim to provide welcome and appropriate learning opportunities for all children.  Children with special educational needs are monitored by our Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO), who will work closely with the parents and support the child’s key person to ensure the child’s needs are met.</p>

			<h1>Information for new parents</h1>
			<h2>Attending pre-school</h2>
			<p>We understand that starting Pre-school can be a big step for you and your child. Before your child starts you are invited to come to Pre-school with your child to meet the staff and other children. Each child is an individual and settling in takes longer for some children than others. You are welcome at any time to discuss your child’s needs/worries with your child's Key person or Pre-school leader.</p>
			<p>We believe children learn through play and at our Pre-school activities are guided by the children's interests and the Early Years Foundation Stage.</p>
			<p>All the children are allocated a Key Person who will help your child settle into pre-school life, get to know your child, where their strengths lie and where they may need encouragement. The key person  will meet with you regularly to discuss your child's progress and exchange information.</p>
			<p>We aim to nurture your child’s talents, develop your child’s social skills, encourage their independence and help a smooth transition into school life.</p>

			<h1>Facilities and resources</h1>
			<p>The Pre-school building and resources are well maintained to ensure the safety of the children. The resources we have are age appropriate, inclusive and challenging.</p>
			<p>To ensure all areas of learning are covered the Pre-school is divided into the following areas which are all well stocked:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>craft area which always has paint, sticking and dough available</li>
				<li>a home area which on occasions is turned into a shop, café, hospital etc</li>
				<li>a computer and other ICT equipment e.g. Remote control toys</li>
				<li>comfy book area</li>
				<li>maths area</li>
				<li>writing area</li>
				<li>small world area </li>
				<li>outside area which includes climbing equipment, sandpit, water play, wendy house, blackboard and well stocked shed filled with trikes, scooters, balancing beams, den building equipment and much more!</li>
				<li>The children have access to the outside area for most of the session whatever the weather, so wellies and waterproof suits are always available.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have our own kitchen, so plenty of cooking activities take place, and the children can easily access the toilets and cloakroom themselves which aids independence.</p>
			<p>The photo above shows the children in the outside area enjoying the 'Community Blocks'  following a very generous grant given to us by Mangotsfield Parish Council, of which we are very grateful.</p>
			<p>The children get so much pleasure from these inspirational and imaginative blocks of fun!</p>

			<h1>Learning</h1>
			<p>The Pre-school uses the Early Years Foundation Stage as guidance for the activities we plan for the children.  However, our main inspiration comes from careful observations of the children during play, regular termly meetings with parents to discuss their child’s progress and interests and also by communicating with other settings that a child attends.  By doing this we are able to ensure that individual needs and interests are being met.</p>
			<p>During most of the day the children take part in child initiated activities both indoors and outside. The children also take part in adult led activities e.g. hello song, show and tell, story time, key group time and for the older children Letters and sounds activities. The amount of time spent on adult led activities increases  as the children get closer to school age.</p> 
			<p>During the course of the school year we have visitors join us in the Pre-school, e.g. Firemen, Nurses, Dentists, Zoolab and pets.  We also cover topics such as the seasons, Christmas, religious celebrations and looking after ourselves.</p> 
			<p>A weekly list of activities can be seen on the notice board outside of Pre-school and is emailed to parents.</p>

      <h2>Attending Preschool</h2>
      <p><span class="lead">We understand that starting Preschool can be a big step for you and your child. Before your child starts you are invited to come to Preschool with your child to meet the staff and other children.</span></p>

      <p>Each child is an individual and settling in takes longer for some children than others. You are welcome at any time to discuss your child’s needs/worries with your child's key person or Preschool leader.</p>
      <p>We believe children learn through play and at our Preschool activities are guided by the children's interests and the Early Years Foundation Stage.</p>
      <p>All the children are allocated a key Person who will help your child settle into Preschool life, get to know your child, where their strengths lie and where they may need encouragement. The key person  will meet with you regularly to discuss your child's progress and exchange information.</p>
      <p>We aim to nurture your child’s talents, develop your child’s social skills, encourage their independence and help a smooth transition into school life.</p>
      <h2>Documents for new parents</h2>
      <p>Parents are expected to read all <a href="/policies.html">policies</a> before accepting a place.</p>
      <h2>Admission Criteria</h2>
      <p>We must stress that although the Preschool is within the grounds of St Augustine's Primary School, they are separate establishments. Therefore having a place at the Preschool does <em>not</em> mean you will get a place at the primary school.</p>
      <p>If oversubscribed the following criteria will be followed:
        
        <ol><li>Catholic children of St Augustine's Parish.</li>
        <li>Catholic children of other Parishes.</li>
        <li>Siblings of present children (i.e. 2 or more children at Pre-school at the same time).</li>
        <li>Siblings of children attending St Augustine's Primary School.</li>
        <li>Other children whose parents wish them to attend (If we are over subscribed places will be allocated on distance from school, as the crow flies).</li></ol>
</p>
         
        <p>Children attending the Pre-school are able to use their grant funding to cover the cost of fees. Nursery Education Grant is currently available from the funding period after your child turns 3. We also accept disadvantaged 2 year old funding. The funding periods are 1st September to 31st December, 1st January to 31st March and 1st April to 31st August. Further information and application forms will be provided by the Pre-school nearer the time that your child becomes eligible. Grants are also available for children who have special needs and for those who may not be able to afford the fees.</p>

        <p>We do also accept work place vouchers.</p>
         
        <p>We hope this information has been useful. Please do not hesitate to contact the Pre-school should you require any further information.</p>
